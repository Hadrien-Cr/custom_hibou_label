# Trace and multi-trace analysis in full observation with HIBOU


## General principle

At the crossroads of the domains of Model-Based-Testing and Runtime-Verification there exists a practice of "offline analysis" when dealing
with the verification of systems which expected behaviors are modelled formally (i.e. with a model written in a formal language).
This practice of "offline analysis" is informally represented in the diagram below.

It consists in obtaining some form of "trace of execution" from a past execution of the System Under Test, and "verifying" it against
the model. This "trace" is most oftentimes collected and/or translated from log files that can be generated by the SUT.
The "verifying" part relies on the definition of a formal semantics for the model, which must be written in a formal language.
Finally, an Oracle can perform the verification and return a "verdict" which assesses the "conformity" of the input "trace" w.r.t. the input "model".

This form of "offline analysis" alone does not constitute a proof of correctness for the implementation.
As most testing practices (e.g. classical software testing with unit tests)
it is simply here to increase confidence in the implementation and/or fulfill some quality standards.

In hibou_label, this general workflow translates into the following diagram.
The "model" is the specification of an interaction via a .hsf file and the "trace" comes in a .htf file.
Then hibou_label can be called with the sub-command "analyze" and produces a certain verdict,
which possible values and corresponding meanings we detail later on in the README when evoking the "analyze" sub-command.
